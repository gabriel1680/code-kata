# Shopping Cart Kata

## What do we want to build?
We are building a shopping cart for an online grocery shop.  The idea of this kata is to build the product in an iterative way.

## Technical requirements
The price per unit is calculated based on the product cost and the percentage of revenue that the company wants for that product.
The price has to be rounded up; so if a price per unit calculated is 1.7825, then the expected price per unit for that product is 1.79
The final price of the product is then calculated as the price per unit with the VAT rounded up.
Products are not allowed to have the same name.
