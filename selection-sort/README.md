# Selection Sort

Selection is a in-place sorting algrithm, wich means that it does not create any other arrays, but change the position of the original.

It's complexity is quadratic constant => O(n^2) = Omega(n^2)

The current implementation considers a copy of the original array and returns the sorted copy.
