# code-kata

This is a repository for my code katas, tdd training and problem solving

Not all examples will be in the same language, but to warm up I started with simple problems and TS.
I would like to use this to implement more complex algorithms and learn new languages basics.

If you found this repo, feel free to suggest some algorithms for me!

Thanx.
