# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a in-place sorting algrithm, wich means that it does not create any other arrays, but change the position of the original.

Algorithm complexity: Î©(n) - O(n^2)

The current implementation considers a copy of the original array and returns the sorted copy.

This algorithm search through the entire list making comparisons with pairs until the greater value is at the last index of the list.
Then it make all again, but without reaching the last index.
